Discovering vulnerabilities quickly with targeted scanning.

Targeted scanning is a powerful approach to discovering vulnerabilities in your systems quickly and efficiently. It’s all about focusing your efforts on specific assets, services, or components that are more likely to have weaknesses. Here’s how you can leverage targeted scanning for faster vulnerability discovery:
1. Identify Critical Assets

    Prioritize high-risk areas: Focus scanning efforts on your most critical systems, such as databases, web servers, and services that handle sensitive data. By targeting these, you maximize your chances of finding impactful vulnerabilities quickly.
    Inventory management: Maintain an up-to-date inventory of your assets so you know exactly what to target.

2. Leverage Automation

    Automated vulnerability scanners: Use tools like Nessus, OpenVAS, or Qualys to automate scanning. They can quickly detect known vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in specific systems.
    Scheduled scans: Automate the scanning of specific assets on a regular basis to ensure that vulnerabilities are discovered as soon as they appear.

3. Use a Risk-Based Approach

    Exploitability focus: Look at assets that are more likely to be exploited or are exposed to the internet (e.g., public-facing web applications, unpatched systems). Prioritize these targets.
    High-value targets: Focus on areas that are high-value for an attacker, such as privileged access accounts, authentication systems, or systems holding sensitive data.

4. Integrate Threat Intelligence

    Known exploits: Use threat intelligence feeds to identify zero-day vulnerabilities or new attack vectors. This allows you to focus on vulnerabilities that are actively being targeted.
    Current attack trends: Scan for vulnerabilities that align with current industry threats, which can help prioritize scans that are most likely to identify active attack vectors.

5. Vulnerability Contextualization

    Application and system context: Don’t just scan for all vulnerabilities—understand the context of the systems you’re scanning. For example, a vulnerability in a non-production server is less critical than one in a production environment.
    Business impact: Prioritize vulnerabilities that can have the highest business impact, even if they're not the most technically severe.

6. Rapid Feedback & Remediation

    Real-time alerts: Many vulnerability scanners allow for real-time alerts, which help you respond quickly to newly discovered vulnerabilities.
    Integration with DevOps: In fast-moving environments, integrate vulnerability scanning with CI/CD pipelines to catch vulnerabilities during development or staging phases.

By focusing on these targeted scanning strategies, you can uncover vulnerabilities more efficiently and address them before they’re exploited by attackers.

---

There are several tools and strategies you can use for targeted vulnerability scanning. Below are some popular tools, along with how they can help you implement targeted scanning:
1. Nessus

    What it is: Nessus is one of the most widely used vulnerability scanners. It’s known for being highly configurable and capable of scanning a variety of systems, including network devices, databases, web servers, and endpoints.

    Targeted Scanning Features:

        Advanced filters: Nessus allows you to filter scans by severity, risk, and type of vulnerability.
        Patch management: Nessus can help you discover unpatched systems or vulnerable software versions.

    How to use it for targeted scanning:
        Target specific IP ranges or systems that you’ve identified as high-risk.
        Scan only critical services (e.g., web servers, databases) and prioritize known vulnerabilities associated with them.

2. Qualys

    What it is: Qualys is a cloud-based vulnerability management platform that offers continuous scanning and real-time detection of vulnerabilities.

    Targeted Scanning Features:
        Tagging and categorizing assets: You can group systems into categories like “critical,” “development,” or “production,” making it easier to focus your scans on the most important assets.
        Vulnerability prioritization: Qualys uses CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) and risk-based analysis to prioritize findings and help you focus on high-severity vulnerabilities.

    How to use it for targeted scanning:
        Segment your assets: Focus on scanning specific asset groups with critical data or services.
        Leverage Qualys’ threat intelligence to scan for specific, high-impact vulnerabilities (e.g., actively exploited zero-day vulnerabilities).

3. OpenVAS (Greenbone)

    What it is: OpenVAS is an open-source vulnerability scanner that offers comprehensive scanning capabilities, including network services, software, and web applications.

    Targeted Scanning Features:
        Configuration options: OpenVAS allows for tailored scan profiles, so you can create scans for specific systems or service types.
        Port scanning: You can specify which ports to scan or limit scans to certain services.
        Vulnerability filtering: You can customize scan results to show only critical vulnerabilities or a particular type of vulnerability (e.g., misconfigurations).

    How to use it for targeted scanning:
        Scan specific networks (e.g., public-facing or high-value internal systems) and define scan parameters (e.g., HTTP or SSH services).
        Use custom plugins to scan for specific vulnerabilities that are relevant to your infrastructure.

4. Burp Suite (for web applications)

    What it is: Burp Suite is a popular web application security testing tool. It can be used for a wide range of web app vulnerabilities, from SQL injection to cross-site scripting (XSS).

    Targeted Scanning Features:
        Crawl and scan: You can target specific URLs, paths, or parameters in web applications.
        Custom scanning: Customize the scanning scope to focus on particular functionality (e.g., authentication mechanisms, session management).
        Active and passive scanning: Use active scanning for detailed vulnerability testing and passive scanning for less invasive assessments.

    How to use it for targeted scanning:
        Target specific URLs or application endpoints that handle sensitive data.
        Manually configure scan parameters for areas that are likely to have security flaws (e.g., login forms, payment gateways).

5. Rapid7 InsightVM (formerly Nexpose)

    What it is: InsightVM offers dynamic vulnerability management and scanning capabilities, including asset discovery, risk prioritization, and remediation tracking.

    Targeted Scanning Features:
        Live vulnerability management: Continuous, real-time vulnerability detection and risk prioritization.
        Asset groups: Similar to Qualys, InsightVM lets you create asset groups, so you can focus scans on critical infrastructure.
        Vulnerability context: InsightVM provides contextual information about the business impact of vulnerabilities, helping you prioritize.

    How to use it for targeted scanning:
        Define assets by risk category (e.g., critical systems, high-value assets) and apply tailored scan templates.
        Use smart scan features to focus on specific types of vulnerabilities that are most relevant to your environment.

Best Practices for Targeted Vulnerability Scanning

    Define the Scope Clearly: Know exactly what assets you want to scan. This could be a specific network segment, a set of critical servers, or applications with sensitive data.
    Tailor Scan Frequency: Regularly scan high-risk areas but use less frequent scans for systems with a lower risk or lower business impact.
    Leverage the Right Tools for the Job: Use specialized tools for specific environments—like Burp Suite for web apps, Nessus for general network scanning, or OpenVAS for cost-effective open-source scans.
    Integrate with Other Security Tools: Combine your vulnerability scanning with other tools like SIEM systems (Splunk, for example) to get full visibility on threats and vulnerabilities.
    Prioritize Based on Business Impact: Use a risk-based approach to focus on vulnerabilities that could have the most significant business impact, rather than trying to fix every single issue found.
    Automate Remediation: Where possible, automate remediation steps or integrate scanning into your CI/CD pipelines to catch vulnerabilities early in the development process.
